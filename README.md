# multi_agent_data_collector
This repo is to create a multi-agent system that collects data. The idea is to try and play with these systems and see how they work. Preferably trying to use crew AI in the process. 



**Learnings**:
* Crew AI is actually built on of Lang chain. It's one of the dependencies. Lang chain and Lang Graph are lower level whereas Crew AI is a higher level abstraction.
